->Space technology is technology for use in outer space. Space technology includes space vehicles such as spacecraft, satellites, space stations and orbital launch vehicles; deep-space communication; in-space propulsion; and a wide variety of other technologies including support infrastructure equipment, and procedures.</p>
<p style = "font-size: 30px;">
->Space technologies designate technologies used to enable activities conducted in outer space, such as Earth observation, satellite communication, satellite navigation or even robotic and human space exploration beyond Earth’s orbits. These technologies are often developed by space agencies, governments, and private companies, and can serve a variety of motives.

When it comes to climate action, the unique viewpoint available from Earth’s orbits on the planet allows for global coverage and accurate monitoring of changes at different scales. It is highly beneficial for monitoring climate change, mitigating its causes, helping adapt to its consequences, and finally supporting society to become more resilient.  

Earth observation satellites are for instance able to monitor changes in the atmosphere and on Earth’s surface at a spatial resolution of a few dozens of meters to a few dozens of centimeters depending on the type of sensors used. In addition, contrary to a plane or a drone which provides an observation platform during a limited time at an altitude of below 14 km, satellites allow for a much larger coverage for much longer.</P><br></br>

->There are numerous types of space technology used to explore the solar system. They are used to explore planets, moons, asteroids, and comets within the solar system. These include fly-bys, orbiters, landers, and rovers.</p>
